Hi, I'm Robert Bossaert — the CTO at Yard | Digital Agency. I lead our efforts to craft enterprise-grade websites using WordPress and develop community platforms and applications with Symfony, focusing on supporting organizations with a social mission.

## Other work experience

Over the years, I’ve honed my skills working with major telecommunications companies and broadcasting organizations. These experiences taught me invaluable lessons about programming, team building, and delivering impactful solutions at scale.

## What I'm working on

Currently, my primary focus is on Python and PHP, but my curiosity extends to other programming languages and frameworks. I enjoy learning, experimenting, and pushing the boundaries of what technology can do.
