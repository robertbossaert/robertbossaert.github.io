## Moving from Eleventy to Pelican

Wait... what? You might be wondering why I decided to move from Eleventy to Pelican, especially given how powerful and well-supported Eleventy is. The site is now powered by Pelican and (still) hosted on GitHub Pages.

Don't get me wrongâ€”Eleventy is fantastic and continues to receive frequent updates. However, I enjoy experimenting with different tools and techniques, and given my fondness for Python, Pelican felt like a natural choice. Also, Pelican is pretty awesome too.
