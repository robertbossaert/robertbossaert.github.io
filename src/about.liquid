            <p>Hi, I'm Robert Bossaert — the CTO at Yard | Digital Agency. I lead our efforts to craft enterprise-grade websites using WordPress and develop community platforms and applications with Symfony, focusing on supporting organizations with a social mission.</p>
            <h2 class="font-bold text-lg">Other work experience</h2>
            <p>Over the years, I’ve honed my skills working with major telecommunications companies and broadcasting organizations. These experiences taught me invaluable lessons about programming, team building, and delivering impactful solutions at scale.</p>
            <h2 class="font-bold text-lg">What I'm working on</h2>
            <p>Currently, my primary focus is on WordPress and Laravel, but my curiosity extends to other programming languages and frameworks. I enjoy learning, experimenting, and pushing the boundaries of what technology can do.</p>
            <h2 class="font-bold text-lg">About this website</h2>
            <p>This site serves as a personal hub where I share a bit about myself and showcase my personal projects. Thank you for visiting!</p>
